INTRODUCTION
In the existing system the people must go to the office, or any responsible department for any kind to lodge a complaint or seek help. 
Secondly, the people lodge the complaints but cannot get the details of the problem. 
This system does not have much popularity and is not user friendly.
DRAW BACKS

All records are maintained on paper documents which makes it less secure as it can be misplaced or misused.
